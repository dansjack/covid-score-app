        U.S. county.</string>
    <string name="riskExplanationText">To calculate the risk of being exposed to COVID, we need
        to start with the probability that any one person has COVID, which is a simple division of
        active cases by total population.\n\nWe can interpret the complement of this probability to
        be the probability that any one person doesn\'t have COVID.\n\nWe then multiply this by
        itself for as many people as there are in the group, e.g. if the probability of 1 person not
        having COVID is 0.5, then the probability of 2 people would be 0.5*0.5 = 0.25, for 3 people
        it would be 0.5*0.5*0.5 = 0.125, and so on.\n\nThe resulting value can be interpreted as the
        probability that nobody in the group has COVID.\n\nSo the complement of this can then be
        interpreted as the probability that someone in the group has COVID, and this is the value
        that we display to you.</string>
